  'Feature Flag': 'A software development technique that lets you enable or disable features without deploying new code. Also called feature toggle.',
  'Feature Toggle': 'Another name for feature flag. The terms are interchangeable, though "feature flag" is more common today.',
  'Kill Switch': 'A feature flag specifically designed for emergency feature disabling. Allows instant rollback without deployment.',
  'Canary Release': 'A deployment strategy where a new version is rolled out to a small percentage of users first. If metrics look good, the rollout expands gradually.',
  'Blue-Green Deployment': 'A deployment strategy using two identical environments (blue and green). Traffic switches from one to the other, enabling instant rollback.',
  'Dark Launch': 'Deploying a feature to production but keeping it hidden from users. Allows testing with real traffic and data without user impact.',
  'Trunk-Based Development': 'A source control strategy where developers merge small, frequent changes to a single main branch. Feature flags replace long-lived feature branches.',
  'Percentage Rollout': 'Gradually releasing a feature to an increasing percentage of users (e.g., 1% → 5% → 25% → 100%). Minimizes blast radius of bugs.',
  'Sticky Bucketing': 'Ensuring a user always sees the same variation once assigned, even if the rollout percentage changes. Prevents jarring experience switches.',
  'Consistent Hashing': 'A hashing technique that maps users to buckets deterministically. The same user key always produces the same hash, ensuring stable flag assignments.',
  'Targeting Rule': 'A conditional rule that determines which variation a user sees based on their attributes. Rules are evaluated in order; first match wins.',
  'Context': 'The object describing who or what is being evaluated. Contains attributes like user ID, email, country, plan tier, and device type.',
  'Context Kind': 'The type of context being evaluated, such as "user", "device", or "organization". Allows multi-context evaluation.',
  'Context Attribute': 'A property of a context, like "email", "country", or "plan". Used in targeting rules to match users to variations.',

  'Operator': 'The comparison function in a rule clause: equals, contains, startsWith, endsWith, matches (regex), greaterThan, lessThan, semVerGreaterThan, etc.',
  'Regex Match': 'A rule operator that matches context attributes against a regular expression pattern. Powerful but use sparingly for performance.',
  'Semantic Versioning': 'Version comparison operators (semVerEqual, semVerGreaterThan, semVerLessThan) that understand version strings like "2.1.0" > "2.0.9".',
  'SDK': 'Software Development Kit. A library you integrate into your application to evaluate feature flags. Available for many languages and frameworks.',
  'SDK Key': 'A unique credential that authenticates your application with the feature flag service. Each environment has its own SDK key.',
  'Client-Side SDK': 'An SDK that runs in browsers or mobile apps. Downloads flag rules and evaluates locally. Must be careful about exposing sensitive targeting data.',
  'Server-Side SDK': 'An SDK that runs on your backend servers. Can evaluate flags locally or remotely. Has access to all flag data securely.',
  'SSE': 'Server-Sent Events. A web standard for receiving real-time updates from a server over HTTP. Used to stream flag changes to SDKs instantly.',
  'Streaming': 'A connection mode where the SDK maintains a persistent connection to receive flag updates in real-time via SSE. Preferred over polling.',
  'Polling': 'A connection mode where the SDK periodically requests flag updates at a fixed interval. Simpler but slower to receive changes.',
  'Long Polling': 'A polling variant where the server holds the request open until new data is available. Reduces latency compared to regular polling.',
  'EventSource': 'The browser API for SSE connections. Creates a persistent connection that automatically reconnects on failure.',
  'Reconnection': 'The automatic process of re-establishing a dropped SSE or streaming connection. Good SDKs use exponential backoff.',
  'Heartbeat': 'A periodic signal sent over a streaming connection to confirm it\'s still alive. Prevents firewalls from closing idle connections.',
  'Flag Evaluation': 'The process of determining which variation to serve for a given flag and context. Checks prerequisites, targets, rules, and fallthrough.',
  'Evaluation Reason': 'Metadata explaining why a particular variation was served: OFF, TARGET_MATCH, RULE_MATCH, FALLTHROUGH, PREREQUISITE_FAILED, or ERROR.',
  'Local Evaluation': 'Evaluating flags directly in the SDK using cached rules, without making a network call. Fast and works offline.',
  'Remote Evaluation': 'Sending the context to the server and receiving the evaluated result. Simpler SDK but adds network latency per evaluation.',
  'In-Memory Store': 'A fast, local cache of flag configurations inside the SDK. Updated via streaming or polling. All evaluations read from this store.',

  'Control Group': 'The baseline group in an experiment that receives the existing experience. Results from treatment groups are compared against the control.',
  'Treatment': 'A variation group in an experiment that receives a new experience. The goal is to measure whether the treatment outperforms the control.',
  'Statistical Significance': 'The confidence that an observed difference between variations is real and not due to random chance. Typically requires p < 0.05 (95% confidence).',
  'Confidence Interval': 'A range of values that likely contains the true effect size. A 95% CI means if you repeated the experiment 100 times, 95 would fall in this range.',
  'Chi-Squared Test': 'A statistical test used to determine if there\'s a significant difference between expected and observed frequencies. Common for conversion rate comparisons.',
  'Bayesian Analysis': 'An alternative to frequentist statistics that calculates the probability that one variation is better than another. More intuitive for non-statisticians.',
  'Conversion Rate': 'The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., sign up, purchase). A common metric in A/B tests.',
  'Sample Size': 'The number of users needed in an experiment to detect a meaningful difference with statistical confidence. Too small = unreliable results.',
  'Environment': 'An isolated configuration space like production, staging, or development. Each environment has its own flag states and SDK keys.',

  'API Key': 'A credential for accessing the feature flag management API. Different from SDK keys; used for administrative operations.',
  'CORS': 'Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. HTTP headers that allow browsers to make requests to a different domain. Required for client-side SDKs.',
  'Rate Limiting': 'Restricting the number of API requests a client can make in a time window. Prevents abuse and ensures fair resource usage.',
  'Exponential Backoff': 'A retry strategy where wait time doubles after each failure (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...). Prevents overwhelming a recovering server.',
  'Graceful Degradation': 'Designing systems to continue functioning when parts fail. SDKs should serve cached flags when the server is unreachable.',
  'Circuit Breaker': 'A pattern that stops calling a failing service after repeated failures. Prevents cascade failures. Resets after a cooldown period.',
  'Tech Debt': 'The accumulated cost of shortcuts and deferred cleanup. Old feature flags are a common source: they clutter code and confuse developers.',
